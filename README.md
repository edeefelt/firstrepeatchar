# firstrepeatchar
Returns first repeat character reading left to right or null string "" if no repeat character is found.
Just an interesting whiteboard session I did recently. I was thinking there was a library in python to return the indexes of the tested character and found it pretty easily.
# mostcharinstances
Added another one that's a slight tweak to the original
